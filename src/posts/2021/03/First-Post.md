# Who are you, really?
 If we met you in person, we'd have some idea. Of course, being human, how you *look* would instantly give us all sorts of preconceptions about you, some correct, some completely off base, for better or worse.

 If we meet online, we have *no idea* who you are. You could be an American, a sockpuppet, a dog (so they say), or just a smart and maybe devious computer program. How can we know?

 Here's how it's done now: "Please sign up by choosing your username and password. Follow our rules for unguessability. And don't use anything you already remember. Oh, *we need to know you're human*, so please take a minute to solve this little puzzle correctly. It'll be fun. Hmm, wait a minute... Now we need your private contact info. An email address or phone number will do. Please wait while we check that it's real. Ok, now you are permitted on our site. We'll remember you next time - just enter this information again. Thanks for all your info. Now we just need to ask you a few questions for your profile..."

 This is where the phone gets thrown out the window.

 We're tired of this. Wasting our time like this is unnatural and annoying. It's not fair. It's also super easy to fake your identity. Why does the whole world have to submit to this every day?

 We don't. This kind of work is literally exactly what computers were invented to do. There's a better way, using lots of fancy math hidden under the hood. We're building it now. Stay tuned.
